Without the Orthodox cross mounted high on the steeple of this church, this church could pass for a United Church.

That’s because it originally **was** a United Church.

As the “Lamont County’s Self-Guided Church Tours” booklet explains, a number of local people became disenchanted with the Catholic Church in the area and in 1925 started to hold services in a local home and by 1936 an official Ukrainian congregation was created.

After 1938 services were held in the nearby community hall and a decade and a half later the parish purchased the Unwin United Church building, originally built in 1917, for $350 and moved it to the present site.
