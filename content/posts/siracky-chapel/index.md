Before the Transfiguration of Our Lord Ukrainian Catholic Church (Spas Moskalyk) church was built, Peter Siracky hosted services in his home for family members and neighbours. In 1940 he had this chapel built on his property in the style known in Europe as the “Church of the Weary Traveller” or the “Church of the Road”.
