I'd been on this trail a couple of times before but it's been a long time since the last visit. It's named Misasin by fellow geocachers, so I'm going with it. It was fun exploring new sections of it today.

In the photos you can see how the earth explodes in growth over the spring and summer months out here. That's in sharp contrast to the lack of any foliage at all during the cold winter months.
