{{< imgRight "incontent/IMG_1857.jpg" "50" "Three cachers walking on the ice" "(l-r) Licwid, VP and protonspinner start out on the sometimes spooky, always crunchy ice walk" >}}Eight of us met at Shiningbank Lake to do a grand loop around the shoreline where geocaches were hidden. First we needed to walk straight across the middle of the lake though. Pucker up and walk! It was really fun. We could hear the ice groaning as it shifted in the depths of the lake which at first was quite eerie.

There was very little snow on the ice so we could see how the thick the ice was and there was really no danger at all of it breaking under our weight.
