{{< imgRight "incontent/20250822_110411-Push_Shelter_Today.jpg" "50" "Push Shelter - Complete with Picnic Tables and Toilets" "Push Shelter - Complete with Picnic Tables and Toilets" >}}Today was a combination hike: to train to increase my distance hiking and to perform maintenance on an old geocache hide that that had gone missing. 

I started out from the "Waskehegan Connector Trail", a seldom-used trail that serves as a nifty shortcut to the southern portion of the Blackfoot. It's been a very long time since I'd been here and I do believe the Waskahegan Trail Association maintenance crew have done some work on it this year.

After getting onto the trails and replacing my geocache hide with a new container, I continued east to Push Shelter. I'd been here just a few weeks ago and the place was just as quiet today as it was then.

The return trip was via "Ed's Way", a trail that was new to me. It's a park boundary trail which means it is long, straight and a bit boring to walk on to be honest. But now I can say I've been on it!
