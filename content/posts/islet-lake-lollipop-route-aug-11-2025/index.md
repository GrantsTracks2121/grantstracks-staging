### Where is the Islet Lake Staging Area?

{{< imgRight "incontent/20250811_155350-Islet_Lake_Shelter.jpg" "30" "The large shelter at Islet Lake Staging Area" "The large shelter at Islet Lake Staging Area" >}}There are four staging areas in the Cooking Lake-Blackfoot Recreation Area:
- **Waskahegan**: the largest, serving hikers, skiers and equestrians,
- **Islet Lake**: the most pictureque in my opinion, serving hikers and kayakers,
- **Central**: serving equestrians and hikers,and
- **Blackfoot**: serving equestrians and hikers.

[Extensive trails](https://www.albertaparks.ca/parks/central/cooking-lake-blackfoot-pra/information-facilities/trail-report/) connect these staging areas for what seems like an endless supply of route choices.

Islet Lake is on the near the southern boundary of the park.

### The Lollipop Route
You might be wondering about the "Lollipop" in the title of this post. No it has nothing to do with holding a big round lollipop in front of me as I hiked around the Blackfoot today. I learned that a "lollipop" route is one where you follow a path, do a loop and eventually meet up with the same path you took before when returning to your starting point. The shape of that route is kinda, sorta like a lollipop.

Well, if you see the route I took below, I messed up the "lollipop" shape on the way in because I wanted to explore a trail I'd never been on before I reached my first destination, Push Shelter. But I hope you get the idea.

The walking conditions were excellent today: the sun was shinning, the wind was calm and the temperature was moderate. Those conditions, the chance to walk along trails I haven't been on in years, and a few cool finds along the trail made this outing a pure pleasure.
