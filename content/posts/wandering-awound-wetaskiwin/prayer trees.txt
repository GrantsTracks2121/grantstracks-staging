Merging Hopes and Desires With the Natural Processes of the Universe

In my explorations of out of the way places over the years, I've noticed bundles of bright-coloured cloth wrapped around trees. I knew this is a native tradition of making prayer and after some research I found that locally in Alberta it's fairly safe to say that these "Prayer Trees" or "Ribbon Trees" are a Métis tradition. 

But it's interesting to know that humans follow similar practices all over the world, including the Celts in Ireland and other peoples in Europe, for example. Expanding on the basic idea, we can see that in Japan, people follow the same practices, but in the case "prayers" are written on wooden plaques and left at shrines and temples.



In Cree and many other First Nations traditions, the practice of placing cloth on a tree is part of making prayer offerings, often involving tobacco ties, to the Creator or spirit world. These offerings are a physical manifestation of a prayer, a wish, or an expression of gratitude. 

Here, in Canada, the prayer ties are left in a sacred spot, often tied to a tree, to weather and eventually disintegrate. It is believed that as the cloth breaks down and the wind and rain carry the material, the energy from the prayer is released and sent to the Creator.

This practice reflects a deep spiritual connection to the earth and the belief that all elements of nature are intertwined and sacred listeners to human prayers and intentions.

Visitors to Japanese Shinto shrines or Buddhist temples write prayers or wishes on wooden plaques called *ema*. 

Once inscribed with a wish, ema are hung at the shrine until they are ritually burned at special events, symbolic of the liberation of the wish from the writer.
