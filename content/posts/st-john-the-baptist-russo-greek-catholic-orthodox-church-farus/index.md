This church was built in 1907 and is named “Farus” after the original owner of the land on which it was built.

As the “Lamont County’s Self-Guided Church Tours” booklet notes, “the church’s tripartite shape points to its early construction date, as does the closed dome and the absence of a choir loft, both of which required sophisticated construction methods that were not readily available.”
