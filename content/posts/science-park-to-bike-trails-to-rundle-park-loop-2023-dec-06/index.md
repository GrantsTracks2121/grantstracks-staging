I really didn't know what I was getting myself into when I started the loop hike from Science Park. First, I knew I had get around around a big gully formed by water flowing to the North Saskatchewan River. Then I found the mountain bike trails along the south side of the river west toward Goldstick Park were **some gnarly** in spots. After those challenges, the rest was a breeze. It took me along the north side of the river through Rundle Park and finally across the Science Park bridge and back to parking.

The leg south of the river had some very steep hills. I had to go down one on my bum; there was no other way.
