Others had the same idea: when we arrived the lot was almost full at the trailhead.

025-IMG_5690.jpg;-114.532036,50.287061;16.40;33.60;77.50;Long after leaving the treeline and negotiating the winding, scree-covered path up, this prominent outcrop in the foreground shows the scale of the land and mountains in the background.

The finding hint for this one was "In a hole Covered by rocks", which was almost no help at all given there was nothing but rock and rock covering rock up here. But eventually it was found.
035-IMG_5700.jpg;-114.527764,50.288842;11.70;37.60;85;You can see the old Cameron Fire Lookout hut just beside my ear. Seeing the goal like that and knowing how much effort was yet needed to get there was almost cruel.

050-IMG_5706.jpg;-114.524414,50.290233;13.73;-106.40;75;The view in all directions is breathtaking from the lookout window. The commanding mountain range to the west is the most impressive.
055-IMG_5709.jpg;-114.524292,50.290328;15.01;-72.80;80;After all the effort it took to get here, I made of point of taking pictures of what had been the end goal "up there" for so long during the climb.

065-IMG_5721.jpg;-114.527108,50.289189;16.27;-125.60;57.50;The majority of the geocaching event participants shot back down the mountain with four of us taking as much time as we needed (and it was a substantial amount) to descend.

075-IMG_5740.jpg;-114.563400,50.282428;14.87;-61.61;73.50;We took a new trail down to Cataract Creek when descended back to the trailhead. This trail is built on the original trail which was partially obliterated by floods in 2013. This trail offers much more gradual slopes and is recommended.
