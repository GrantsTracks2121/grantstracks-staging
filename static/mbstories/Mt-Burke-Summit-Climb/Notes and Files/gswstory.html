<h2>At 7:40 am the parking Lot is almost full</h2>
<img src="assets/005-IMG_5656-thumbnail.gif"></br>


<!--BEGIN Chapter 005 Description-->
Temperatures had been hovering around 30 C in the days leading up to this one, so we wanted to get as early a start as possible in the hope that we'd beat at least some of the day's heat. Others had the same idea: the lot was almost full at the trailhead.

<h2>The direct route up a well-travelled cutline</h2>
<img src="assets/010-IMG_5661-thumbnail.gif"></br>


<!--BEGIN Chapter 010 Description-->
This 2D image doesn't accurately show the 3D slope of the "Direct Route" cutline we followed initially. It was an unrelentingly hard slog nowhere but straight up.

<h2>Beauty shines when you attend to it</h2>
<img src="assets/015-IMG_5665-thumbnail.gif"></br>


<!--BEGIN Chapter 015 Description-->
As you ascend, one's focus is on the physical effort and psychological mind games during the climb. But noticing little bits of beauty along the way bring brief reminders of the pure joy of being here.

<h2>A sentinel outcrop above the treeline</h2>

<!--BEGIN Chapter 025 Description-->
Long after leaving the treeline and negotiating the winding, scree-covered path up, this prominent outcrop in the foreground shows the scale of the land and mountains in the background.

<h2>A Geocache Find Along the Way</h2>
<img src="assets/030-IMG_5692-thumbnail.gif"></br>


<!--BEGIN Chapter 030 Description-->
There are number of geocaches hidden along the path up the mountain. The finding hint for this one was "In a hole Covered by rocks", which was almost no help at all given there was nothing but rock and rock covering rock up here. But eventually it was found.

<h2>A rare selfie with the summit in the background</h2>

<!--BEGIN Chapter 035 Description-->
You can see the old Cameron Fire Lookout hut just beside my ear. Seeing the goal like that and knowing how much effort was yet needed to get there was almost cruel.

<h2>The summit seems to be guared by rock walls</h2>

<!--BEGIN Chapter 040 Description-->
We're getting closer to the top and it seems to be guarded not only by elevation, but rock walls as well.

<h2>The Cameron Lookout Built in 1929 is showing its age</h2>
<img src="assets/045-IMG_5704-thumbnail.gif"></br>


<!--BEGIN Chapter 045 Description-->
Cameron Lookout was built in 1929 and finally decommissioned in 1954. During that time it was the highest fire lookout in Canada. The structure is slowly returning to earth.

<h2>The view from the lookout window</h2>

<!--BEGIN Chapter 050 Description-->
The view in all directions is breathtaking from the lookout window. The commanding mountain range to the west is the most impressive.

<h2>Cameron Lookout Perched on the Summit</h2>
<img src="assets/055-IMG_5709-thumbnail.gif"></br>


<!--BEGIN Chapter 055 Description-->
After all the effort it took to get here, I made of point of taking pictures of what had been the end goal "up there" for so long during the climb.

<h2>Starting back down</h2>
<img src="assets/065-IMG_5721-thumbnail.gif"></br>


<!--BEGIN Chapter 065 Description-->
The majority of the geocaching event participants shot back down the mountain with four of us taking as much time as we needed (and it was a substantial amount) to descend.

<h2>Cataract Creek is completely dry</h2>
<img src="assets/075-IMG_5740-thumbnail.gif"></br>


<!--BEGIN Chapter 075 Description-->
We took a new trail down to Cataract Creek when descended back to the trailhead. This trail is built on the original trail which was partially obliterated by floods in 2013. This trail offers much more gradual slopes and is recommended.
